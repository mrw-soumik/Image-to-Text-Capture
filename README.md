# Image-to-Text-Capture

This tool gives users the ability to take a screenshot and copy to the clipboard the text content of the screenshot. Works on Windows, macOS, and 
most modern Linux distros.

Use
Running textshot.py will open an overlay over the screen, where a rectangle can be drawn over the portion of the screen containing the text the user wishes to copy.

It is recommended to attach a global hotkey to this tool.

On Windows, one can accomplish this by using an AutoHotkey script; textshot.ahk contains a sample AHK script that can be used.
On Ubuntu, open the Keyboard Settings, which shows you all the Gnome shortcuts. At the bottom there is a + button to add your own shortcuts.
Click it and set the command to /usr/bin/python3 <path-to-textshot.py>. In case you are using a venv, the python3 path above should point to
the venv's python3 instead of the global python3.
